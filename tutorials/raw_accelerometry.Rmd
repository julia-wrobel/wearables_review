## Notes

From Vadim, goals are to

- show how complex this pipeline is
- important to illustrate the processing steps that need to be done. Can be super sophisticated or can be common sense..
  - We probably want to focus on simpler versions of this that get you 80-90% of the way there 
- We will have a separate tutorial for minute level and higher level sumamaries for that 

## Analysis

Begin doing whatever is supposed to get done.
